## Summary

- Technical writer with 7+ years of experience documenting RESTful APIs, developer tools, and complex internal systems.
- Passionate about making complex systems approachable. I thrive on reducing confusion for developers, support teams, and end users through clear, structured documentation that actually gets used.
- Adept in Postman, OpenAPI, Git workflows, SQL, and languages such as Python and Swift.
- Leads documentation efforts end-to-end, from tooling and style standards to cross-functional training and onboarding.

## Professional Experience

### Freelance API Technical Writer

October 2023 - July 2025

- Produced API documentation for technical and non-technical audiences, including tutorials, overviews, reference, and integration guides for RESTful services using Postman, OpenAPI, and GitHub.
- **Client A (Oct 2023 to Jun 2024)**: Sole technical writer for a startup. Delivered Postman-based reference docs by reading Node.js codebases and manually testing endpoints.
- **Client B (Jun 2024 to Jul 2025)**: Rebuilt a custom documentation generator in Python. Diagnosed critical issues in the OpenAPI layer, including a brittle override file masking widespread nonstandard behavior. Proposed long-term architectural fixes to improve consistency, enable better automation, and make documentation more maintainable.
